# Introduction

This is me following the ["Writing your first Django app"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/) tutorial from the official Django documentation.

# Deviations from the tutorial

For the sake of learning, I am purposefully avoiding the usage of the django.shortcuts module.

- This means that I am not using commands like `get_object_or_404` or `render`.
- There are separate branches that do use shortcuts and generic views.

Some other minor deviations include

- slightly different flavor text and variable names.
- more comments, especially ones related to HTTP
